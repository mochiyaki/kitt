## KITT
Let's go!

## Inspiration
KITT is inspired to actually disrupt the existing way of big online retailers, shipping companies and trucking companies are optimizing loads in their fright fleet and containers.

## What it does
KITT uses the dreamer v3 physics base world model to predict the most optimal way of loading a container, a truck with all your shipment data and also uses weather prediction to adjust the load depending on the route and predict traffic as well, the goal is simple optimize loading in trucks to the point you dont have any kind of loading related delays or damages to the item at any cost.

## How we built i
We built it using and leveraging opensource models that are both LLM and also non diffusion world models, our physics engine can predict the most optimal layout and loading weight and items for any available truck in your fleet by calculating every single metrics from your files.
